So I've been on a writing jag all last week and I hope it moves into this one.  I run a wiki for my D&D world that has been languishing over the last few months.  But I've picked up working on it again and I'm trying to get some good content out before my game on Saturday.  One can only hope...

The Board has been reset. Time to get moving. Good morning, Soda!
