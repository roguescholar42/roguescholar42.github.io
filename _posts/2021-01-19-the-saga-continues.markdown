So I fixed both connections in IFTTT, but FaceBook isn't posting and it's just... sigh... it's fine.

I don't know if yet another change in FaceBook's TOS as made it so that you can't automate posts even for pages, which I was forced into using. Honestly, at this point I don't feel like pouring over documentation.  Don't know what I'm going to do about that connection point yet.  The smart money is currently on the "I don't care anymore," train. 

I might be moving all my social connections over to Twitter now that it's slightly less of a hornet's nest.  We'll see.  

Back to the coding pits to work with technologies that I actually want to work with.
