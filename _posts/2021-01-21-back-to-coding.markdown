Looks like the website is caching it's records in the social repositories that it should.  Albeit a little slower than I'd like.  

Took the day off coding yesterday because of the whole, Democracy was saved thing.  It's great to finally have the Trump Administration in the rear view.  

But it's a new day and back to coding for me.  The new site stands up and has the very basic functionality to be called a blog and it looks like hell, but I put it together with my own hands.  Now just comes the work of getting to feature parity with the current site and making it look... I'm not going to say pretty... just better than it currently does.
