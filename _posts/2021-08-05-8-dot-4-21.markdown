It's August. When the hell did that happen? While a lot of people have that "losing time" feeling, I've found that I get it the most when I haven't written in a while.

It's been about a month since I've written in my journal, done any notes, or written any fiction. Therefore I'm picking blogging back up after a few months to get time out in front of be as opposed to behind me, as it were.

I've also scheduled the last session of my long running D&D campaign. That feels pretty strange, but I'll unpack all that after I run it.  (Might be on here, might not. What's important is a throwing a writing prompt for myself in the future.)

Anyway, That's what's going on in this moment today.
