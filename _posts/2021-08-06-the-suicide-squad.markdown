Well... that was actually unexpected.  Just got done watching watching The Suicide Squad on HBO Max, and I was shocked at the quality jump between that and the first one.  I knew it was going to be better because they hired James Gunn to write and direct. Considering WB hired a trailer house to chop up the last one to make it more like Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy, this was good - if surprising - call. 

What can I say? The movie is well made and smart but that's not why I like it. I like it because it is the weirdest thing to come of the Hollywood system in years and it shoves three hours of movie at you in two hours and never feels rushed. 

It's real strange and is the kind of stuff I used to make up when I was 14.  Makes me happy to know there's still a place in this world for weird and wonderful. I'd go see it if I were you.
