Just finished a major video game jag.  Been playing Cyberpunk 2077 for the last few weeks.  I want to finish it before any new content comes out for it, but I've set this weird rule for myself that I have to have all of the side quests and missions done before I can finish out the main story line.

Luckily the publishers, CDPR, are taking their time to put out new stuff for it. 

I've been playing the game on and off since I picked it up last December.  (I played day one on a base model Xbox One, and it was a buggy mess.  I am very brave.) 

It's been quite enjoyable, so I've been savoring it like a fine wine because we aren't likely to get 80's style cyberpunk on this scale ever again.  As it turns out, reality caught up with our anxieties over the worst impulses of the Regan's America. But the maps never included boring and banal the dystopia would be.  

One of the most striking things about the game is there are no suburbs, which we now know was the birthplace of most of the problems cyberpunk was trying to warn us about. 

Still, there's something cathartic about running around a future that'll never be, which is commenting on a present that is all too real.
