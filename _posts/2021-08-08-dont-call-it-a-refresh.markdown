One the themes of this blog has been the site refresh as the current Jekyll theme isn't everything I want. I've been picking at this project off and on for months, and have reengaged in earnest a few days ago. 

However, I've decided to rebuild the entire site as a self-hosted Wordpress Blog for arcane reasons that I'll go into in a later post. 

Assuming, of course, I don't brick the entire data repository and have to start over. (Which I can tell you won't happen quickly as I stare at a wall for months trying to figure out where shit went wrong.)

So today I'm going for a walk to clear the head then it's into the heavy lifting of importing all of this content into the test instance I have running on a Raspberry Pi.

This might be a heavy post day.
