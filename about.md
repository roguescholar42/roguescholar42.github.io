You've reached the personal site of Josh Evans.  This is a repostory of my morning thoughts - not always in the morning. Just an overview of what I'm working on/thing about. 

I'm a IT person and writer living in the Greater Boston area.  

Seeing as I'm interested in both technolgy and words, this site is going to be a constant work in progress. Please don't be alarmed if you point your browser to here one day and the URL won't resolve.  I've either broken something beyond all hope of recovery, or I've finally said "to hell with it" and let the whole endever fall into the sea.

## Site's current tech setup

- **Site Engine:** [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- **Theme:** Slightly modified version of [WhiteGlass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass)
- **Hosting:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
